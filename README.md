<p>The <b>Game of 15</b> (also called <b>Gem Puzzle</b>, <b>Boss Puzzle</b>, <b>Game of Fifteen</b>, <b>Mystic Square</b> and many others) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle" title="Sliding puzzle">sliding puzzle</a> that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing. The puzzle also exists in other sizes, particularly the smaller <b>8-puzzle</b>. If the size is 3×3 tiles, the puzzle is called the 8-puzzle or 9-puzzle, and if 4×4 tiles, the puzzle is called the 15-puzzle or 16-puzzle named, respectively, for the number of tiles and the number of spaces. The object of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order by making sliding moves that use the empty space.

To solve the puzzle, the numbers must be rearranged into order.

<p>The <i>n</i>-puzzle is a classical problem for modelling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" title="Algorithm">algorithms</a> involving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science)" title="Heuristic (computer science)">heuristics</a>. Commonly used heuristics for this problem include counting the number of misplaced tiles and finding the sum of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_distance" class="mw-redirect" title="Taxicab distance">taxicab distances</a> between each block and its position in the goal configuration.<sup id="cite_ref-Korf,2000_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Korf,2000-1">[1]</a></sup> Note that both are <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admissible_heuristic" title="Admissible heuristic">admissible</a></i>, i.e. they never overestimate the number of moves left, which ensures optimality for certain search algorithms such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm" title="A* search algorithm">A*</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Korf,2000_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Korf,2000-1">[1]</a></sup>
